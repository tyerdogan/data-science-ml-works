# Decision Tree Experiments (Classification)

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks focused on **Decision Tree–based classification** workflows.  
The main objective is to explore how decision trees behave on different datasets and feature spaces, from preprocessing to model evaluation.

The notebooks are designed to be **educational, readable, and reproducible**, following a standard machine learning pipeline without overengineering.
