# Seoul Bike Demand Regression (EDA + Linear Regression)

This mini-project is a course assignment (Linear Regression) notebook that demonstrates a complete regression workflow on an hourly bike demand dataset:
EDA → feature engineering → preprocessing → baseline regression → cross-validation  → regularization → sanity-check scenario test.

> Developed and executed in **Google Colab**.

## Dataset
Hourly aggregated bike rental demand data from Seoul’s public bike-sharing system, combined with ASOS weather variables (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, solar radiation, etc.).

- Target: `Rented_Bike_Count`
- More dataset + licensing details: see **`DATASET.md`**
